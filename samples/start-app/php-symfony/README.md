# Start App PHP Symfony

## Requirements
- You’ve got a PIM developer sandbox. If not, please contact us ([https://www.akeneo.com/contact/](https://www.akeneo.com/contact/))
- You’ve installed Docker (20.10.22 or higher)

### Step 1: Get this App on your local machine
Use [GitZip](https://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/): enter [https://github.com/akeneo/sample-apps/samples/start-app/php-symfony](https://github.com/akeneo/sample-apps/samples/start-app/php-symfony) in the form at the top right.

### Step 2: Create a tunnel to expose your local App
Use [ngrok]([https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)) to create a tunnel that allows your App to be accessed using a unique HTTPS URL. You need to create a ngrok account and auth token to preview your App.
```
ngrok http 8000
```

### Step 3: Declare your local App as a test App in your sandbox to generate credentials
In your sandbox go to Connect > App store > Create a test App
Paste your callback & activation URLs
```
Activate URL: [your-ngrok-url]/activate
Callback: [your-ngrok-url]/callback
```

The App generates the credentials. Copy them for later.

### Step 4: Launch your App
Open a terminal at the root of the folder of your App, enter the following command and let us guide you
```
make install
```

### Step 5: Activate your test App for your sandbox
1. Back in your sandbox go to Connect > App store
2. You see your App in the section “My App”
3. Click on CONNECT
4. Follow the activation process steps until the end

If everything is good, you should see
[TODO Add picture (when App done)]

It means your App is connected. Well done!

### Step 6: Call your first API endpoint

Last but not least, let’s call the PIM API!
Simply go to [TODO URL of my-first-api-call]

You should see
[TODO Picture of the result]

You will find a pre-configured HTTP client here [TODO link to the code of the HTTP call]. Feel free to use it for your project.

Voilà! You are ready for developing your App!
